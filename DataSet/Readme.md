Amongst, 19023 files, .wav files were enough to test the filter, Band Pass filter was designed and executed. Presented are the all the .wav files required to proceed
Designing a band-pass acoustic filter for a poultry farm involves several steps to ensure the filter meets the specific needs of the environment. 
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   Determine the optimal frequency range for the chicks' health and well-being.
   Identify unwanted noise frequencies that need to be filtered out.

2. **Specification Definition**:
   Define the cut-off frequencies for the band-pass filter (both lower and upper).
   Set the desired filter characteristics such as bandwidth and attenuation.

3. **Filter Design**:
   Choose an appropriate filter topology (e.g., Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel) based on the desired characteristics.
   Calculate the component values (capacitors, inductors, or resistors) required for the filter.

4. **Simulation and Testing**:
   Use simulation software (e.g., MATLAB, LTspice) to model the filter and analyze its performance.
   Adjust the design parameters as needed to achieve the desired frequency response.

5. **Prototyping**:
   Build a prototype of the filter circuit.
   Test the prototype in a controlled environment to verify its performance.

6. **Implementation**:
   Install the filter in the poultry farm's acoustic system.
   Monitor the acoustic environment to ensure the filter effectively enhances the health and well-being of the chicks.

7. **Evaluation and Optimization**:
   Continuously evaluate the filter's performance in the real environment.
   Make necessary adjustments and optimizations to maintain optimal sound levels for the chicks.
